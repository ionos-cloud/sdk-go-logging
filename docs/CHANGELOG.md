## SDK Go Logging Service v1.0.0

### Overview
This is the first release of the SDK Go Logging Service.

Logging Service is a service that provides a centralized logging system where users are able to push and aggregate their system or application logs. This service also provides a visualization platform where users are able to observe, search and filter the logs and also create dashboards and alerts for their data points.


**Note:** Logging Service is currently in the **Early Access (EA)** phase. We recommend keeping usage and testing to non-production critical applications. Please contact your sales representative or support for more information.
